1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:02,302
This was a hallway!

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:05,106
Hallway, hallway, hallway,

3
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:06,968
my room, fireplace!

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,976
This is where I kept my formal
crowns, my casual crowns,

5
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:10,311
my "just for fun" crowns.

6
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:13,414
Yes, this is definitely
where my castle was!

7
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:14,482
Okay, are we done?

8
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:15,850
Because I either need to find your army

9
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:17,452
or I need to go and find another one

10
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:18,820
so I can go and save Isabella.

11
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:21,055
Oh, relax, chisel chin. You'll get my army.

12
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,990
I just have to figure out where they went,

13
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:24,725
and if they took my castle with them.

14
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:26,194
Strangest thing...

15
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:28,963
I-I know I've never seen
this village before,

16
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:32,667
and yet somehow it seems
oddly familiar to me.

17
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,204
I say, peasant, I have a question,

18
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:38,439
and please don't get all star-struck

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,640
because I'm speaking to you directly.

20
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,143
No way! It's you!

21
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:43,311
I know. You're flustered.

22
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:46,147
Guys, look, it's Sir Galavant,
the famous knight!

23
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:49,317
Hello. Hi.

24
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:50,918
What a thrill!

25
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:54,055
Is there perhaps someone else
here you recognize?

26
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:56,357
Maybe...Your king?

27
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:58,325
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

28
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,396
Greetings, lowly ones!
It is I, King Richard!

29
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:04,699
I have returned! Good to see you again.

30
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,000
So, I have a question.

31
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,769
What the hell happened to my castle?!

32
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,205
Yeah, we, uh... We sort of tore it down

33
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,674
to make homes and shops for everybody.

34
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,843
Oh, well, that would explain
the familiarity.

35
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:16,944
You knocked it down?!

36
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:18,913
I demand you rebuild it immediately,

37
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:21,449
or I will have every one of you
drawn and quartered and...

38
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,583
What's going on?

39
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,052
W-why are they not scurrying
to do my bidding?

40
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:27,488
Oh, well, here's the thing.

41
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,725
When you left us to go in search
of the Jewel of Valencia,

42
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:33,861
we didn't hear anything
for a really long time.

43
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:35,696
All right, that's fair. That's on me.

44
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:36,998
I should've sent a pigeon or two.

45
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:38,933
Yeah, but while you were away,

46
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,202
we realized that a king is only a king

47
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,603
if the people say he is.

48
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,272
And if they don't,

49
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:47,375
well, he's just a man with a metal hat

50
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:48,843
who's only in charge

51
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:51,112
because his father wore
a metal hat before him,

52
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:52,847
which is pretty crazy
if you think about it.

53
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,617
You know, he's... He's got a point.

54
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:57,818
It<i> is</i> pretty crazy.

55
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:01,355
Hmm. So, then we came together
and asked ourselves,

56
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,891
"what if there was a different
way of doing things?

57
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:04,959
A better way?

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,761
A fairer way?"

59
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:08,162
Oh, no. I know what's coming.

Touchy.

112
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,433
Hello, my friend.

113
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:11,769
Richard!

114
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,937
Surprise!

115
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:14,338
What are you doing here?

116
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:16,372
Oh, just thought I'd pop in for a visit.

117
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,275
Come here, you. Give us a hug.

118
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,547
Oh. My favorite crown.

119
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:25,448
Don't worry. I'll get it.

120
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,453
What the hey, Gareth?

121
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,160
Aah!

122
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,530
Oh, bloody hell. Not again!

123
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:42,566
That is the third time this week

124
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,702
the king has woken me
because of his screaming!

125
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,804
I think he's having bad dreams, My Queen.

126
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,006
I want you to fix it.

127
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:50,741
How do I do that?

128
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:51,675
Not my problem.

129
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,577
What is my problem is

130
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:55,880
his screaming is interrupting
my beauty sleep,

131
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,081
and do you know what happens

132
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,150
when a queen loses her beauty sleep?

133
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:02,119
She can sleep in later
because she's a queen

134
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,921
and she can do whatever she wants?

135
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:06,056
She could get a wrinkle.

136
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:08,526
And if she gets a wrinkle...

137
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:10,694
She'll make sure <i>you</i> get a wrinkle.

138
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,595
On your neck!

139
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:15,399
I'm sorry. I'm not being very clear.

140
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,234
I'm really tired. What I'm trying to say is

141
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,769
if you don't fix it, I'll cut your throat.

142
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,037
Okay? Nighty-night.

143
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:26,076
"No. I never loved you, Isabella."

144
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,345
"But I don't understand, Galavant."

145
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:30,880
"Too bad, sucker. I'm outie."

146
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:34,285
Play it again.

147
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:35,219
Oh, apologies, My Lady,

148
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,587
but do you really think it's healthy

149
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:38,255
to keep reliving this breakup
with Galavant?

150
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,157
I said, play it again.

151
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:45,795
"I'm Galavant, the jerkiest jerk
in all the land!"

152
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,765
Excuse us, Jester.

153
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,567
May we have a moment with our daughter?

154
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,068
Oh, thank God.

155
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,305
Sweetheart...

156
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:57,608
As you know, we're very sorry
about Galavant ditching you.

157
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,743
He dropped you like a plague rat.

158
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:01,378
But it's been several days,

159
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,615
and that biological sundial
of yours continues to grow long

160
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,450
- if you know what I mean.
- You're 25!

161
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:09,186
My mother was a great-grandmother by then!

162
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:10,588
And while we're happy you agreed

163
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,223
to be forced to marry your cousin,

164
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:14,992
maybe it's time to start
making some decisions, hmm?

165
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:16,527
At least meet the wedding planner.

166
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:18,128
He's very excited to meet you.

167
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,763
I don't care about any of it

168
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:21,665
if I'm not marrying someone I love.

169
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,500
Oh, sweetheart!

170
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,502
Marriage isn't about love!

171
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:29,706
Let me introduce you to Mr. Wormwood!

172
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:39,750
Princess Isabella, how delightful.

173
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:42,786
Chester Wormwood of
Wormwood Weddings and Events.

174
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:47,257
I'm here solely to serve
your every wish and desire.

175
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:51,862
This is our new Rec Center.

176
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:52,863
We're very proud of it.

177
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,133
Oh...My...God.

178
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,369
Those curtains used to be my sheets.

179
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,204
I know because I had the R's embroidered

180
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:01,872
with the plucked hairs of
all the kingdom's redheads!

181
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:04,041
You'll find we've turned
everything from the castle

182
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,408
into something for the common good.

183
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:09,313
Are you sure you're not planning
some big surprise

184
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:11,315
where you're gonna wheel away
some huge wagon

185
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:14,852
to reveal you've rebuilt
my castle but only better, huh?

186
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:16,320
Sorry, buddy.

187
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,856
Ah! Oh!

188
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:19,823
"Buddy!"

189
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:21,325
Oh, great. That's what it is now.

190
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:23,894
It's not "My King" or "Your
Worship" or "Your Highness."

191
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:25,194
It's "buddy."

192
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:28,364
God!

193
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:32,102
I have a question.

194
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,504
Do you still have an army?

195
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,873
A citizen's army, yeah.

196
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,275
Good. I'd like to use it
to invade Hortensia.

197
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:40,077
Absolutely not.

198
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:41,312
Really?

199
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:43,180
Well, hang on.
I thought this was a democracy.

200
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:45,149
Aren't you supposed
to let the people decide?

201
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,418
Oh, yeah.

202
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,887
Tell you what, there's
a town-hall meeting tonight

203
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:52,222
where anybody can bring up new business.

204
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,224
- Why don't you give it a shot there?
- Okay.

205
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,260
Now, I can't imagine
a free people ever voting

206
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:58,629
to send an army into an
open-ended foreign conflict

207
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,164
which profits only the few.

208
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:02,298
That would be madness.

209
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,469
Well, s-sure.

210
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,904
But you're forgetting one thing.

211
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:07,938
This smile.

212
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:10,240
Oh, yeah.

213
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,942
Oh, yeah. It's nice, isn't it?

214
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:13,077
Help, help!

215
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:15,211
- That's my tunic!
- Get off, get off!

216
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:20,927
Sir, have you been having
bad dreams?

217
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,663
Who's been telling you
I'm having bad dreams?

218
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,998
The queen!

219
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:26,968
She's heard you screaming
at night and wants me to help!

220
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,737
- Come here.
- Oh, God, this is it!

221
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:31,305
Shut up!

222
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:33,407
I'm not gonna kill ya!

223
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,276
Yes, okay.

224
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,211
I've been having bad dreams
about King Richard.

225
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:40,047
I don't know what to do.

226
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:43,250
Well, when I was younger,
I had a recurring nightmare.

227
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,218
But then my mom helped me
figure out what it meant,

228
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:46,286
and it went away.

229
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:49,022
No, this is more complicated than that.

230
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,424
It's more of a riddle.

231
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm always holding king Richard's crown!

232
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:55,661
He's accusing me of betraying him.

233
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:59,266
Yeah, that's a real enigma.

234
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:01,702
Do you think that maybe you're feeling...

235
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:04,337
I don't know... A little...Guilty?

236
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:05,605
What's "guilty"?

237
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:09,309
Oh, um...

238
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,178
When you feel bad about what you've done.

239
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:13,046
That's not a thing!

240
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,182
I'm wasting my time talking to you!

241
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:25,625
What do you think?

242
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:28,595
How about "die for the guy
who wants his gal"?

243
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:32,099
See, "Gal" is a play
on your name, and it rhymes.

244
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,366
Yeah, I think it's good.

245
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,368
I just think it's a bit dumb for me.

246
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,871
Oh, oh, but it's not too dumb for<i> me?</i>

247
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:40,474
Can't even write a slogan
for a stupid election.

248
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:42,642
I'm not a writer. I'm not a castle owner.

249
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,010
I'm not a king.

250
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:45,212
Do we have to do this again?

251
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:47,914
Do what? Realize I'm in
the darkest hour of my soul?!

252
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:51,117
Just go win your stupid election.

253
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:53,687
Okay.

254
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:54,755
- Hello.
- Hello.

255
00:09:54,756 --> 00:09:56,189
- Galavant.
- It's an honor.

256
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,257
Are all the stories true?

257
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:02,996
Hi. King Richard.

258
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:06,466
Or is it just "Richard"?

259
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,002
Honestly, I have no idea what I am.

Now, remember, not a word about my plan.

308

The wedding plan?

309
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:24,271
I thought that's why she's coming.

No, the evil plan, you idiot...

311

The one to control her mind
with this enchanted tiara

313

I thought that was the scheme.

314
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:36,416
No, the scheme is the colors.

315
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,350
I'm confused.

we'll call it "The Wedding Plan,"

00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:46,493
"The Evil Plot," and "The Color Scheme."

320
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:48,261
Got it? Good.

321
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:49,462
Oh, she's here. Be cool.

322

Mother, I may have agreed to get married,

397
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:31,987
Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea!

398
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:35,691
So, they would prefer to decide
their fate by majority opinion

399
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,243
rather than being ruled by me,

400
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,229
whose right to kingship
was passed down from ancestors

401
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,165
said to be a god and a mermaid.

402
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,466
Fools.

403
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,235
What are you? The town drunk?

404
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,503
I wish.

405
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:49,672
At least then I'd know
what I was supposed to be.

406
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:51,339
That position was already taken.

407
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,643
Lucky bastard.

408
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:57,246
Right, that concludes all old business,

409
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,882
uh, but I do believe we have
one bit of new business.

410
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:02,618
Galavant, the floor is yours.

411
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:07,022
Hello. Galavant.

412
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:10,159
I've come to ask
to take your army to Hortensia

413
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,595
to rescue my one true love.

414
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,496
Who? Madalena?

415
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:16,031
No. Isabella.

416
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:17,600
Didn't you already do this?

417
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,768
I don't think I'm quite
explaining this properly.

418
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,937
You see, Isabella is actually
being held hostage.

419
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:24,006
We know. In Valencia.

420
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:26,775
Uh, no. Again, that's Madalena.

421
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,611
Isabella is in Hortensia.

422
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,046
I don't think he knows
what he's talking about.

423
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:32,414
No, I do.

424
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:33,782
You're just not listening.

425
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:37,052
It's true love, people.
I just need your vote. Please?

426
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:43,359
Uh, die for the guy who loves his gal?

427
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,627
Boo!

428
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:47,463
Can you hear yourself?

429
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,332
- Look, hey, listen...
- Hero?! More like zero!

430
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,867
You suck!

431
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:53,434
I can't believe what I'm hearing!

432
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:59,074
Standing before you
is a man of noble intention,

433
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:01,343
a man who knows what his purpose is...

434
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:02,978
To be a hero!

435
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:04,913
And I admire that.

436
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:07,583
While I am no longer your king...

437
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:10,686
Unless, of course, you'd like
to put it to a quick vote?

438
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:12,388
All in favor? Yes?

439
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,690
Anyone? Hmm? No?

440
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:15,824
Fine.

441
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,993
But if I<i> were</i> still your king,

442
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,996
I would force every one of you
to join this man's army,

443
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:22,865
not because I was a tyrant
and a terrible leader

444
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,166
who hosted baby fights,

445
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,701
which I now realize is weird
and not that entertaining,

446
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:27,102
even after the addition of the cobra,

447
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:30,606
but because true love is rare
and worth fighting for.

448
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:33,575
It is life's greatest purpose.

449
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:35,477
So...

450
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:39,515
As someone who is "not" your king...

451
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,283
I ask...

452
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:44,285
Who will join this fight for true love?

453
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,525
I will join, King Richard!

454
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,998
Well, there we go. That's a good start.

455
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:58,801
Right. Who's next?

456
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,738
Anyone at all?

457
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:07,042
Well, this is certainly uncomfortable.

458
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,309
Pbht.

459
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:15,584
Aah!

460
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,554
You did this to me!

461
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,756
Aah!

462
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:23,158
Shh! Are you trying to get me killed?!

463
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,694
I saw his head! It was right there!

464
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:27,329
And it was giving me that look.

465
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,266
My King, I think I know what's going on.

466
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:32,968
Richard was your friend.

467
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:36,839
And, yes, you took his throne
and his queen and his kingdom

468
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,640
and his favorite shirts
and his weekly bridge game...

469
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,842
Oh, get on with it!

470
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:43,979
But the fact you feel bad
about it is a good thing.

471
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,916
It means you're actually,
surprisingly, human.

472
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:50,218
Maybe I do feel guilty.

473
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,256
I do miss the old bastard.

474
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:57,393
Look, there was one other thing

475
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:58,993

There's one more in there.

483
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:28,022
Oh.

484
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,199
So, what now?

485
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,802
I'm off to Hortensia to rescue Isabella,

486
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,070
recruit some soldiers along the way,

487
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:45,073
and after that, march to
Valencia to reclaim her kingdom.

488
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,743
Well, I have a surprise.

489
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:50,379
Your old pal Rick's gonna join you!

490
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,080
What? No. No, no, no, no.

491
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,550
You said you were gonna stay
here and figure out who you are.

492
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,518
And I did. I realized I'm the guy

493
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,020
who's going to help you rescue Isabella.

494
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,655
Even though, technically,

495
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,390
I'm the guy who started the whole disaster.

496
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:03,025
So, what do you say?

497
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,660
Why not?

498
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,995
Awesome! You, me, Roberta.

499
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:08,330
Oh, this is Roberta, by the way.

500
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:10,332
Do you remember her
from... from the election?

501
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,667
She stood up, pledged to join me.

502
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,901
Watch this.

503
00:20:12,902 --> 00:20:15,103
Oh, Roberta?

504
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:16,872
Yes, My King?

505
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:18,173
She calls me "king."

506
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:19,174
Oh, my God.

507
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,009
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun!

508
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,944
No, it's not.

509
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:23,378
Well, we should probably go.

510
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:25,581
I stole these horses and just
set fire to the Rec Center.

511
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:28,049
Dismantle my castle, will you?

512
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,892
Princess Isabella,

513
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,795
isn't there something
you might want to say?

514
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:42,331
Good news, everyone!

515
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,299
I've set a date for my wedding.

516
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,470
It's in six weeks, and you're all invited!

517
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:55,711
Does something seem different
about Princess Isabella?

518
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,248
Who cares? She's getting married!

519
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,716
Boom! Boom!
